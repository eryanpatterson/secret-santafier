# Secret Santafier

This is the front-end code for [secretsantafier.com](https://secretsantafier.com). The back end code, along with a Readme for the back-end, can be found [here](https://github.com/eryanpatterson/santafier-server). 

The front-end is a React SPA using React Router. There are three main components as well as a layout component, as well as two subcomponents: Form and Modal. The Modal accepts props in order to display a heading and body text upon receiving a 200 response from an call to fetch().

I used Tailwind CSS for the styling, and for the most part it was a dream.
